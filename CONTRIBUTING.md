# Contributing Guidelines

I would love to have you contribute to `PACKAGE NAME` if that is of interest! I would divide contributions into two categories: (1) function ideas that aren't coded and (2) functions that are written in scripts. Once you've decided which of these categories you fall into, follow the instructions under the relevant subheading.

## Function Ideas

If you have an idea for a function submit your idea to sparkle.malone@yale.edu, and jmatthes@wellesley.edu to add a discussion of your function to the flux gradient working group meeting.

## Function Scripts

If you've already written up an R function in a script you have two options for getting it added to `PACKAGE`:

**Scripts Option A**

 - [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/lter/lterwg-flux-gradient/tree/main/R) and paste your function into it


## Contribution Credit

In return for your generous contribution to `PACKAGE` you can consider the following modes of credit:

 - Add you as a contributor in the `DESCRIPTION` of the package with a link to a professional website of your choosing
 
 - Put your name in the README of the repository next to the description of your function

Note that I make no distinction between contributing a function idea and contributing written code in terms of credit received.
